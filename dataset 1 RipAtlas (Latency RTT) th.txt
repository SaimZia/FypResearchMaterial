research paper 7:(supporting)
Real-time latency prediction for cloud gaming applications
Network Health Metrics (Very Important for You)

Your research question asks:

What network health metrics can determine optimal switching points?

This paper gives you:

RTT (Round Trip Time)

Jitter

Packet delay variation

Bandwidth fluctuation

✔ You can cite this paper to justify which metrics your master server monitors before switching.

2️⃣ Decision Trigger Logic

The paper predicts latency before it becomes bad.

You can use this idea to say:

Our system predicts upcoming latency spikes and proactively switches from P2P to a dedicated server (or vice versa) to maintain gameplay quality.

✔ This strengthens your architecture switching logic.
